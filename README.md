### Description:
The project is written in ```lua```, using the ```Löve 2D``` framework. It is a simulation of two maze solving algorithms, and a maze generating algorithm.

To generate the maze, the program uses ```Prim's``` algorithm, and to solve it there are two implemented algorithms: ```A*``` and ```Breadth-first serach (BFS)```.

To launch the program you need to have ```Löve 2D``` installed and in the main menu you'll have to select the algorithm to solve the maze. If you hit ```ESC``` while one algorithm is running you are going to return to the main menu, where you can select the same or the other algorithm.
